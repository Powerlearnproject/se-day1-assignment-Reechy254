Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering : This is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development of high quality softwares.
Importance of software engineering are: It enable the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life eg, healthcare, communication etc

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages 
Establishment of software engineering as discipline
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: this is where the project is broken down into phases and completed in a sequential order from top to bottom 
Agile; this is where the project is broken down into phases known as sprints and emphasizes teamwork and collaboration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer; responsible for writing and implementing software solutions
Quality assurance engineer; ensures software quality by performing tests and  designing
Project manager;Oversees the planning , execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software suit that provide comprehensive tools for writing, testing and debugging code example include vscode, pycharm etc
Version control systems are software tools that track changes to source code and enable collaboration among teams example include git subversion etc

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing of requirements during the development lifecycle leading to scope creep and delays
Tight deadlines which  causes pressure to deliver projects early which may result to rushed development and compromised quality 
Technical debt incurred from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance cost
Strategies to overcome this challenges include;
Effective communication 
Agile methodologies 
Prioritization of tasks
Regular reassessment of project goals and timeline

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit test : this is the tes of individual components or modules of a software
Integration ;this is type of testing where it is done for interaction between different components or subsystems
System; testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance ; this testing against user requirements to see if it meets the user  needs
Testing is important since it helps to identify and fix defects early in the development process leading to higher quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the  rafting of messages to give instructions to an ai in order to get the best response from it.
With prompt engineering , by crafting precise prompts to an AI model enable a person to get the right out put from the AI
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about dogs instead you could say tell me about the species of dogs available in the USA.
